# Ethereum Fraud Detection
This repo is for Natixis Hacktivity 2022 on Ethereum Fraud Detection.

## Problem Statement
Since its inception, Ethereum has become one of the most popular blockchains in the world. There are now over 207 million Ethereum addresses, and more than 6,000 blocks mined every day. But Ethereumâ€™s fame also attracts various frauds. To keep the Ethereum network sustainable and healthy, it is crucial to detect these frauds. 
In this hackathon event, your mission is to detect fraudulent Ethereum addresses by applying machine learning models to Ethereum transactions. You will be given a dataset of normal and fraudulent addresses, along with their account activities - such as the number of sent transactions, received transactions, transferred ETHs, etc. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set. In the training set, a list of fraudulent addresses have been flagged. You must train a machine learning model on the training set and apply it to the test set. The prediction result will be submitted to the system for scoring. To avoid overfitting of the test set, the number of submissions will be restricted. The submission with the highest score will be winner.
